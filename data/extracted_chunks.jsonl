Insights over my second cup\nThe question everyone seems to be asking: Is AI taking away jobs? More specifically, is it coming for my job?\nI'm adding my voice to the mix\u2014not just with an opinion, but with a fresh-off-the-oven experience.\nWhile working on the logo for my new newsletter The Second Cup, I decided to give AI tools a try. I fed them prompts, described the feel I wanted, and got some options that looked decent to my untrained, design-agnostic eye. Then I ran it by my talented graphic designer niece, Samhitha Chitturi, who has a degree in Art Direction and New Narratives.\nAs expected, she had an allergic reaction. \ud83d\ude05\nNot because she detested AI tools, but because she knew what \"good\" looks like and was irked at me settling for something lesser.\nAfter asking me questions that made me think deeper about the newsletter itself\u2014its target audience, its purpose\u2014she did something that seemed almost too simple. She asked me to write the newsletter name in my handwriting a few different times, in a few different ways.\nShe started with those pieces of paper and turned them into the logo. Simple, yet deeply meaningful. My own handwriting became the authenticity of voice I'm striving for. The colors are warm, earthy, and social-media friendly (she explained all this to me, of course).\nWhat I learned:\nNobody\u2014not even AI\u2014can take away your craft and skills. But there's a crucial difference between having skills and knowing how to leverage them."}

The difference between what AI generates for me versus what it generates for her is night and day. She has the expertise to set the right context, provide the right prompts, and validate using the right benchmarks.\nAI tools certainly help many get a head start without relying on specialized skills. But don't let that trick you into thinking you're suddenly a \"know it all\" who doesn't need those specialized skills anymore. There's a difference between a quick prototype and quality work\u2014whether that's code, design, or anything else.\nHere's the shift: Don't treat AI as a deterrent or threat. Treat it as your assistant. Use it to force-multiply your existing skills so you can work faster and cheaper, giving you more time for what actually matters\u2014life itself.\n#AI #Design #Productivity #FutureOfWork"}

The Over-Engineer Who Meant Well\nTake GP, an engineer who started with us as an intern. He did reasonably well and earned a return offer as an SDE1. As an intern, he met the bar technically and behaviorally, showing strength in some leadership principles more than others. Overall, he was promising. \nBut once he joined full-time, cracks began to show.\nHis manager noticed he was struggling to deliver on time. Tasks routinely ran late, and he often needed help to finish work. Yet, GP was anything but lazy\u2014he was hardworking, eager, vocal in design meetings, constantly seeking guidance, and regularly burning the midnight oil.\nAfter pairing him with a more experienced engineer, the root cause became clear: GP wasn\u2019t lacking skill\u2014he was over-engineering. In his enthusiasm to impress, he made things more complex than necessary, creating self-imposed scope creep. What he thought was exceeding expectations was actually eroding trust in his ability to deliver.\nEventually, his manager had to put him on a formal performance improvement plan. GP was devastated.

It felt like a deep, personal gut punch.\nThough my team and I largely avoided layoffs, we were absorbed into a different organization, adrift without clear direction.

Staying curious keeps you confident and relevant, no matter what wave hits next.

Especially during times of transition, having a trusted network you can lean on, and who can genuinely vouch for your capabilities, goes far beyond relying on recruiters and cold calls.

One of Sapient\u2019s standout features as a new entrant in the consulting space was its bold \u201cFixed Cost, Fixed Time\u201d delivery model, a stark contrast to the industry\u2019s standard \u201cTime & Materials\u201d approach. That model was my crash course in scope management, estimation, risk planning\u2014and most importantly, learning that even the best-laid plans can fall apart. Always have a Plan B.\nEven after I left Sapient, the skills and habits I picked up\u2014especially around estimation and planning\u2014stuck with me. At Dow Jones, I was leading a mission-critical project with a fixed launch date that had already been announced externally.\nWe wrapped up requirements and UX design by April, leaving just five months to build, test, and ship. I was responsible for the overall end-to-end delivery and was deeply involved in every discussion around scope, technical strategy, resources, risks, and timelines. It became clear fast: even with tight scope and fully loaded teams, the only way to hit the timeline was for the team to work weekends.\nMy leads and I were frustrated. If leadership had already locked the date, why ask for our input?"}

If leadership had already locked the date, why ask for our input?\nEventually, our director acknowledged the bind we were in and offered a cash bonus to the team for launching on time. That helped, but what really changed the mood was the way the team came together. Despite the rocky setup, we pulled through\u2014and we delivered.\nThat experience taught me a truth I\u2019ve seen repeated many times since: no matter how thoughtful the culture, how intentional the leadership, or how balanced the environment\u2014there will be moments that demand a stretch. If something is truly important\u2014something the business is counting on\u2014it has to be done on time. Critical opportunities don\u2019t wait. But how leadership shows up in those moments makes all the difference. The way stretch asks are communicated and handled can either build lasting trust\u2014or quietly chip away at it, leading to burnout and eventual attrition.\nWhat I Do Differently Now\nSince leaving the services industry, I\u2019ve worked at two very different companies\u2014Dow Jones and Amazon. While their operating styles couldn\u2019t have been more distinct, in both places I was fortunate to be part of teams building products that truly mattered to the business. That meant strong executive backing, but it also came with constant pressure to deliver faster, better, leaner."}

There will be times when you\u2019ll need to stretch. Sometimes it\u2019s because you underestimated the work. Other times, you\u2019ll need to step up for the team. That\u2019s normal. It only becomes a problem when stretching becomes the default, not the exception.\nI also remind them: Creating a healthy and sustainable work environment isn\u2019t just the manager\u2019s responsibility. Each team member is responsible for understanding their work, estimating it realistically, planning it thoughtfully, and tracking it diligently. Yes, the manager owns the final commitment on behalf of the team\u2014but that commitment should be based on inputs from everyone. If your estimates are routinely ignored and timelines come top-down without discussion, that\u2019s a red flag to be addressed.\nFinally, if you\u2019re never stretched, you\u2019re in the wrong job or too comfortable and stopped growing. If you\u2019re always stretched, you\u2019re in the wrong company.\nFor anyone trying to create a more sustainable and predictable work life\u2014especially in high-pressure, high-tech environments\u2014here are a few ways to assess and adjust:\nBe real and realistic.\nTake time to truly understand your company\u2019s business model, its culture, your team\u2019s operating rhythm, and your manager\u2019s working style.

My focus was always on doing my best, assuming recognition and growth would naturally follow. And early in my career, that seemed true. At Sapient (I was the 70th hire), the company was growing rapidly, and so was I. I had a transparent communication style that kept my manager always in the loop. He could advocate for me even when I wasn\u2019t in the room. Promotions came easily\u2014perhaps too soon, but that\u2019s a story for another day.\nThings shifted when I moved to Amazon as a senior leader (Manager of managers). The environment was less intimate, and just doing good work wasn\u2019t enough. I continued to deliver, often going above and beyond, but I rarely brought up career conversations\u2014thinking it would sound self-serving or awkward.

By not speaking up, I was signaling that I was content where I was. I also reflected on how I treated my team; it was easier to support those who were clear about their growth aspiration vs those who didn\u2019t and ended up disappointed. \n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What changed: Since then, I\u2019ve made it a habit to talk about my career aspirations every 6 months or so. I share my contributions regularly as always, ask for feedback, and openly discuss what\u2019s next. It has made a real difference\u2014not just in outcomes, but in alignment and mutual clarity. Within couple months of doing this for the first time, my manager did a review of my work summary and acknowledged that I was ready to get to the next level L8-Director and we aligned on a possible timeline and preparatory steps needed to present the case.

My consistent performance earned me a reputation as dependable and respected by peers, managers, and team members alike.

That message\u2014simple, timeless\u2014anchors this edition. It is also the #2 point in my previous edition on Bulletproofing your career.\n\ud83d\udd10 Stay Curious. Learn Beyond the Job.\nLet me share two stories that bring this to life:\n\ud83c\udf31 Tale of a self-taught tinkerer \nOne of my first teammates at Sapient was a fresh grad like me and a gifted programmer. In his spare time, he was always building something\u2014carpentry projects, remote-controlled toys for his kids, or home automation devices long before \u201csmart homes\u201d were a thing - all driven by pure curiosity, not grand ambitions.\nEven after we moved on, I followed his journey through his blog (another one of his side projects), as he navigated different industries and roles. What stood out was this: his growth wasn\u2019t limited to his day job. It was compounded by what he explored on his own. His constant hands-on exploration made his skills broader and more adaptable and with it came optionality."}

But there weren\u2019t any immediate opportunities in our org. He didn\u2019t wait. He created a hobby club with other like-minded engineers. They met weekly to explore trends, read research papers, and build side projects. Eventually, they entered our org\u2019s hackathon and demoed an AI-powered solution that caught leadership\u2019s attention\u2014and secured funding. That engineer went on to become a founding member of a new AI team, got promoted, and transitioned into an Applied Scientist role within 18 months.\n\ud83d\udd01 What Do These Stories Have in Common?\nIt wasn\u2019t job titles or timing that made the difference.\nIt was mindset:\nThey didn\u2019t confine their curiosity to their job.\nThey stayed open, self-directed, and eager to explore\u2014without waiting for permission or reward.\n\ud83d\udca1 What Lifelong Learners Teach Us\nLearn for the joy of it.\nReconnect with the curious child in you. Don\u2019t always chase outcomes. Often, what you learn for fun becomes valuable\u2014in unexpected ways.\nFor example, when I got into gardening, I thought I was just learning to grow plants. But it taught me something deeper\u2014how to nurture with care, observe patiently, and avoid overdoing. These learnings, I realize, are just as applicable to raising kids and leading teams\u2014knowing when to step in, when to step back, and how to create the right conditions for others to thrive.\nLet your curiosity wander."}

Those with a comfortable financial cushion can navigate the uncertainty with more ease, taking the time to deliberate on their next move. Those without feel the pressure to grab the first opportunity, even if it\u2019s not the right fit. But this isn't just about crisis moments. Without intentional planning, lifestyle inflation becomes a golden cage. That bigger house, newer car, or premium lifestyle can quietly transform from comfort into necessity, from freedom into obligation. Before long, you\u2019re working to fund your life instead of letting your money support it.\nIn this edition, I want to share how my relationship with money was shaped early on and how it\u2019s helped my family and me live with more freedom and intention through different seasons of life.\nRespect, not worship"}

Growing up in a middle-class or at best upper middle-class family in India, I learned very early on not to take money for granted and to live within my means. My parents tracked every rupee and believed that awareness was the first step to financial clarity. They also taught me never to compare our life to others\u2019, a mindset that has saved me from a great deal of unnecessary pressure and dissatisfaction."}

My husband and I were simply happy we earned enough for what we needed and wanted as a young couple. As we considered buying our first home, my father offered a piece of wisdom that made us think deeper about financial planning: \u201cTry not to over-extend yourself, you still have a long life ahead and having the freedom for one of you to step away from full-time job, if needed is priceless.\u201d I recognize we were fortunate to even consider that kind of option, something many families can\u2019t. Coincidentally, this was the time when a dear friend had just moved into their dream custom home and soon after had their son. Unfortunately, the baby had some health complications and needed multiple surgeries within the first 3 years. What made the situation even more stressful for them was that neither parent could take off from their jobs since they needed both salaries to make the home payments and live their life. This hit home for us. We decided to be more conservative with our financial planning, perhaps one of the defining moments that influenced how we thought about jobs, careers, and money from then on: they should support your life and give you strength, not take over your life.\nThe Power to Walk Away"}
{"file": "/Users/vasanthagullapalli/Documents/Newsletter/financial safety net.docx", "chunk_id": "/Users/vasanthagullapalli/Documents/Newsletter/financial safety net.docx_chunk_3", "text": "The Power to Walk Away\nThat advice from dad contained another crucial insight: The ability to walk away from a job makes you a better employee. It gives you the confidence to do the right thing, to act with integrity, and to stay true to your values. Without that leverage, work environments that don\u2019t suit you can take a toll on you\u2014not just professionally, but mentally, emotionally, even physically. Having the option to walk away makes you less vulnerable and be more selective about where and with whom you want to invest your time and energy to build your career. \nFor example, I was working for Sapient Corp (services firm) when we had our first child. By the time he turned 2, I was also in a senior position and needed to travel extensively as was and still is the norm in the services industry. I was not ready to leave my child with nannies for extended periods of time and so quit the job and took time to find the next one. Thankfully, our conservative approach with our finances gave me the option to leave the job before landing the next one. I was able to step away from my job again just when I was growing well at Dow Jones and this time it was to help the family settle in a new country and also to try out entrepreneurship, freelancing and even satisfy my interest and curiosity in public service."}

They didn\u2019t always \u201cmake sense\u201d on paper. But they were the right ones for us. These diverse experiences helped me gain a much broader perspective about life and made me develop a deep sense of gratitude for what we already had rather than just be caught up in the corporate rat race. \nPeople sometimes ask if I regret those breaks. Did they slow down my career or dent our financial portfolio? Possibly. But not meaningfully. What we gained in flexibility was far more valuable. I believe there\u2019s a time for everything, and if those moments had passed without trying, I wouldn't have had another chance.  I\u2019m grateful I didn\u2019t miss those windows.\nThere's no shortage of financial planning books. I won't replicate their advice. Instead, I want to emphasize one key idea:\nBe intentional about designing your lifestyle, and understand what you're giving up to maintain it.\nWhat if creating freedom for one partner to take career breaks meant choosing a $500K home instead of a $900K one? Which tradeoff feels more aligned with your values? That's a deeply personal decision worth reflecting on. What money means to each of us is shaped by our individual journeys. Turning money into a source of strength, not stress, is an individual process that cannot be turned into a one-size-fits-all checklist. It's about getting clear on your values, priorities, and what freedom means to you\u2014finally understanding what you're giving up and for what.\nNow your turn"}

Our beliefs around money often stem from childhood, culture, or past experiences. Is it a means to an end? Is it safety, freedom, or identity? There is no right or wrong answer, still worth unpacking.\nWhat are your income sources? Which are fixed and which are flexible? What happens if one goes away? Could your current lifestyle continue, and for how long?\nDo you know your monthly run rate? Track expenses for a few months and get clear on your baseline. What portion is driven by your own needs and interests versus keeping up with others? Living well within your means requires thoughtful tradeoffs. What do you value most and refuse to compromise on? Which conveniences are worth paying for? What's optional or driven by \u201ckeeping up\u201d?\nDo you know what the real cost of your lifestyle is? What are you giving up for keeping it up?\nIf this resonated with you, I\u2019d love to hear your story\u2014or learn from someone you know who\u2019s walked a similar path.

That one quiet promise I made to myself became the anchor for many of my work and career choices over the years. It wasn\u2019t always easy, but it gave my decisions clarity\u2014and purpose. For example, this meant I said \u201cno\u201d to promotions or roles that needed extensive travel, also meant I stepped away and took a break from corporate job just when I was growing well in my job to help our family with young children settle down in a new country. \nWhen my boys were young, the juggle was real\u2014and exhausting.

It was the routine ones\u2014like leaders scheduling 5:00 PM meetings, right when I had to leave for daycare pickup. Saying \u201cno\u201d to important meetings again and again wasn\u2019t easy\u2014or well received. That\u2019s when it hit me: my personal constraints didn\u2019t factor into the corporate system. If I chose to stay in it, I had to play by its rules\u2014or accept the trade-offs, like slower growth in certain roles that demanded a lot more of me. \nOnce my boys were a little older, I stepped fully into a fast-paced, high-impact role at Amazon. It was demanding, no doubt\u2014but I held firm to one boundary: evenings from 6:00 to 9:30 were sacred family time. After the kids went to bed, I\u2019d log back in and work another 2\u20133 hours to stay on top of things. It wasn\u2019t easy. I traded personal downtime\u2014my hobbies, my rest\u2014for professional momentum. That was the cost I chose to pay during those years. Still, I\u2019m grateful.
